# Fabian IT Solutions — Cursor Rules

## Non-negotiables
- Follow existing patterns in this repo. If a pattern exists, reuse it.
- Prefer server components. Only use "use client" when required (forms, theme toggle, interactive UI).
- TypeScript strict. No `any` unless there is no reasonable alternative. If used, justify with a short comment.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped. Avoid unrelated refactors.
- Never output partial files. When you modify a file, output the full file.
- If you are unsure, ask targeted questions OR inspect the relevant files first.

## Workflow
- Always do: PLAN -> IMPLEMENT -> VERIFY.
- PLAN: produce a short plan with file paths and what will change.
- IMPLEMENT: apply changes in small batches (ideally 3–8 files per batch).
- VERIFY: list checks: TypeScript, build, routes, lint, and common runtime pitfalls.

## Next.js / Sanity stack constraints
- Next.js App Router under `src/app`.
- CMS content from Sanity via GROQ.
- Create `src/lib/sanity/{client.ts,queries.ts,types.ts,fetch.ts}` and use typed helpers.
- Use ISR revalidation where it makes sense.
- Use shadcn/ui for UI primitives.

## Output format
- Always show file path headers, then full file contents.
- End each batch with a short “What changed” and “How to test locally”.
